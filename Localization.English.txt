Fastly so, I must add! Last mass, she carried herself with the utmost of efforts, given her abnormally inflated abdomen.\n\nSince this last appearance, no news circle of her.\n\nShe replies, from behind her tightly locked doors, so we assume her alive. Most trust on 'well' just as much - but not me.\n\nHer house is never silent, and neighboors complain unerringly of late nights of broken porcelains and yells. Most worried still, her windows sometimes glow in the dead of night with a color I've never seen before.\n\nHelp me uncover what hell she may have birthed into our world."|||
